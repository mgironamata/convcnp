This layer takes as input a set, and embeds it into a function space. The layer will also provide a discretization of the functional representation for the decoder. Further, for convenience, we add an additional, point-wise linear transformation to the functional representation to provide the decoder with the appropriate number of channels.

Note that $\\psi$ can be any differentiable function of this form, e.g., implemented as an MLP. The method `self.rbf` implements $\\psi$ in this example. The helper function `compute_dists` computes the pair-wise distances between vectors of input locations.\n","\n","The forward method for this module accepts as inputs a context set -- $x$ and $y$ -- each of which is an order 3 tensor (batch size, num context points, `dim(x) / dim(y)`), and an additional order 3 tensor of locations ($x_{out}$) at which to evaluate the functional representation of the context set (this is the discretization for the decoder).
